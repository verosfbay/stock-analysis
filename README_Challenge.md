# Stock Analysis Challenge
## Refactor VBA code and measure performance
## Project Overview/Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis is to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. 
I want to make the code work well for a large amount of stocks. I will refactor the code I made previously to loop through all the data one time 
in order to collect the same information that I did previously. Then, Iâ€™ll determine whether refactoring my code successfully made the VBA script run faster. 
  The ultimate goal here is to make the code more efficient and easier for future users to read. Efficiency can mean that the code takes fewer steps, uses less memory or has better logic. 
  
## Results: 
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
  
## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
