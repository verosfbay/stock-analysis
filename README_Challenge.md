# Stock Analysis Challenge
## Refactor VBA code and measure performance
## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. 
I want to make the code work well for a large amount of stocks. I will refactor the code I made previously to loop through all the data one time 
in order to collect the same information that I did previously. Then, Iâ€™ll determine whether refactoring my code successfully made the VBA script run faster.
  
## Results: 
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
  
## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
